 * The <code>Led</code> enumeration lists the LED type identifiers can be used to manage the LEDs on the device with {@link LedManager} interface.

 * Depending on the device, LEDs can be single-color, two-color (red and green) or RGB.</br>
 * Moreover, some of the LEDs defined by this interface could be not supported in some devices. </br>

 * <b>NOTE:</b> SDK v1.38 introduced the {@link #LED_SCANNER} as interface extension of {@link #LED_GOOD_READ}. So, even when they are both supported, they refer to the same physical LED.</br>
