/**
 * This class provides the main interface to manage the item tracking system,
 * which enables real-time detection of items added into or removed from a shopping cart.<br/>
 * Applications can register event listeners using the {@link #addEventListener(EventListener)} method
 * to receive notifications about item insertion or extraction events.<br/>
 * To use the algorithm, a session must be created via the {@link #createSession()} method.
 * The session allows control over the algorithm's execution, including starting
 * ({@link Session#start()}), pausing ({@link Session#pause()}), and stopping
 * ({@link Session#stop()}) the tracking process.<br/>
 * The session is shared across all applications.
 * The first application that calls {@link #createSession()} creates the session,
 * while subsequent applications invoking the same method receive a reference to the session
 * created by the first application.
 * The state of the current active session can be retrieved using {@link Session#getState()}.<br/>
 * Once the session is no longer needed by an application, it must be released using {@link Session#release()}
 * to free resources and ensure proper cleanup.<br/>
 * The session remains active until all applications referencing it release it using {@link Session#release()}.
 * Only when the last application releases its reference, the session is destroyed,
 * freeing resources and preparing for the next tracking session.
